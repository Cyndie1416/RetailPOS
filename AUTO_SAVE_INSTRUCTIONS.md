# 🔄 Automatic Save System

## ✅ **How It Works Now**

When you make any changes in the POS system (add products, process sales, add customers, etc.), the system will **automatically**:

1. **Save all data** to your computer
2. **Download JSON files** to your Downloads folder
3. **Show a green notification** confirming the save

## 📁 **Files That Get Saved Automatically**

Every time you make changes, these files are downloaded:
- `products.json` - Your product inventory
- `customers.json` - Customer database
- `sales.json` - Sales transactions
- `settings.json` - Store settings
- `suppliers.json` - Supplier information
- `orders.json` - Purchase orders
- `users.json` - User accounts

## 🎯 **When Auto-Save Happens**

The system automatically saves when you:
- ✅ **Login** to the system
- ✅ **Add/Edit products** in Inventory
- ✅ **Process sales** in POS
- ✅ **Add/Edit customers** in Customers
- ✅ **Add/Edit suppliers** in Suppliers
- ✅ **Add/Edit users** in Users
- ✅ **Change settings** in Settings
- ✅ **Click "Backup Data"** button

## 📂 **Where Files Are Saved**

All JSON files are automatically downloaded to your **Downloads folder**:
- Windows: `C:\Users\[YourName]\Downloads\`
- The files will have the exact same names as in your `data/` folder

## 🔄 **How to Update Your Data Folder**

1. **Check your Downloads folder** for the new JSON files
2. **Copy the files** from Downloads to your `data/` folder
3. **Replace the old files** with the new ones
4. **Refresh the POS system** to see your changes

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

- **Keep your Downloads folder organized** - the files will accumulate there
- **Regularly move files** from Downloads to your `data/` folder
- **Use the "Backup Data" button** in Settings for manual backups
- **The green notification** confirms your data was saved successfully
